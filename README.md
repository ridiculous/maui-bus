Maui Bus Routes Application
========

An organization of routes, times and locations for the Maui County Bus System. Stored as constants and classes, searching and other mining techniques are easy. Locations have coordinates, which are used in conjunction with Google Maps API V3 to create map markers and draw routes (`DirectionService`). 

Some features:
  1. Search          - click on any bus stop to use it as the origin or destination. Finds direct and indirect routes by joining routes on transfer points
  2. Upcoming Stops  - lists the next 5 (default) stops for each bus on a route
  3. Browser Support - from IE 8 and up to the most recent Chrome
  4. Maps            - every route has a map and every bus stop is marked using its coordinates
